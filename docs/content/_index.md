`th` turns threads.com into clean, scriptable, structured data. It resolves a
profile to a rich record, streams its posts and replies, pulls a single post's
whole thread, and searches, all from one pure-Go binary with no login and no
browser.

```bash
th profile zuck                  # a profile's full record
th profile zuck --posts -n 20    # its twenty most recent posts
th post <url> --replies          # a post and its reply thread
```

`th` reads anonymously, as a web crawler: it asks Threads for the same
server-rendered pages a search engine gets and parses what comes back. Private
content stays private, and `th` is explicit about the wall rather than silently
returning nothing.
